    <h2 style="color:#FF69B4;"> <i> <center> Hello, my name is Paul Cano and I am a senior at Saint Francis High School. I have many interests such as playing musical instruments, playing video games, hangung out with my friends and being with my girlfriend. I am the captian of my school's drumline and I play the marching snare. I also play the alto saxophone in a jazz band. This is just a little snippet of me. </center> </i> </h2>
